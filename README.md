# Alien
 - In version 1, you’ll set up Pygame and then create a ship that moves right and left, and fires bullets in response to player input. 
 - In version 2 and 3, you’ll create a fleet of aliens to destroy, and then continue to make refinements, such as setting limits on the number of ships you can use and adding a scoreboard.
 - Need to install pygame to run this program.
